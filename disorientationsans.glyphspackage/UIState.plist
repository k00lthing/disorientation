"Lowercase Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans is a 2009 American crime drama film directed by Werner Herzog and starring Nicolas Cage Eva Mendes Tom Bower Jennifer Coolidge Alvin Xzibit Joiner Val Kilmer and Brad Dourif. Though the films title and story loosely resemble that of Abel Ferraras 1992 film Bad Lieutenant according to Herzog it is neither a sequel nor a remake its only commonality is a corrupt policeman as the central character. Nonetheless the director of the original Bad Lieutenant film Abel Ferrara expressed dismay that the Herzog film was being made. Both Bad Lieutenant films were produced by Edward R. Pressman. The film premiered on September 9 2009 at the 66th Venice International Film Festival where it won the Christopher D. Smithers Foundation Special Award for Herzog. It opened in general release in the United States on November 20 2009. The film was first announced in May 2008 with Werner Herzog to direct and Nicolas Cage to star. The script was penned by TV writer William Finkelstein. Actress Eva Mendes who starred with Cage in the 2007 film Ghost Rider joined the cast the following June. Screenwriter William Finkelstein submitted the original draft of the screenplay to Herzog with the title Bad Lieutenant. Finkelstein was aware of the 1992 Abel Ferrara film of that name but swore to Herzog that this would not be a remake and the director insisted on renaming the film. The two negotiated over the title and settled on Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans. One major change from the original film was moving the setting from New York City to New Orleans. Herzog insists that the film is not a remake saying It only has a corrupt policeman as the central character and thats about it. At the 81st Academy Awards Herzog stated that he has never seen Ferraras film saying I havent seen it so I cant compare it. It has nothing to do with it. Herzog did not like the idea of a remake and desired to change the title of the film but was unsuccessful. Herzog stated I battled against the title from the first moment on but added I can live with it I have no problem with it at all. The title is probably a mistake but so be it. Principal photography began on Julz7 2008 in Louisiana and also around South Mississippi shooting some scenes at the Hollywood Casino in Bay St. Louis. Lowercase Lowercas",
